CyVerse provides life scientists with powerful computational infrastructure to handle huge datasets and complex analyses, thus enabling data-driven discovery. Our extensible platforms provide data storage, bioinformatics tools, image analyses, APIs, and more. CyVerse Austria uses open source code from CyVerse US (University of Arizona) and its deployment is funded by BioTechMed-Graz . Within the program Digitale TU Graz the follow-up project for expansion of CyVerse Austria (Austrian DataLab and Services) is funded by the BMBWF What is Cyberinfrastructure? \u00b6 Cyberinfrastructure (also known as CI or computational infrastructure) provides solutions to the challenges of large-scale computational science. Just as physical infrastructure such as laboratories makes it possible to collect data, the hardware, software, and people that comprise cyberinfrastructure make it possible to store, share, and analyse data. Using cyberinfrastructure, teams of researchers can attempt to answer questions that previously were unapproachable because the computational requirements were too large or too complex. CyVerse cyberinfrastructure includes: A data storage facility An interactive, web-based, analytical platform Web authentication and security services Support for scaling computational algorithms to run on large, high-speed computers Publication of data by issuing persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI) Education and training in how to use cyberinfrastructure History \u00b6 CyVerse was originally created by the U.S. National Science Foundation in 2008 with the name iPlant Collaborative. From its inception, iPlant quickly grew into a mature organization providing powerful resources and offering scientific and technical support services to researchers nationally and internationally. In 2015, iPlant was rebranded to CyVerse to emphasize an expanded to serve all life sciences.
